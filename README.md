> Dart's null safety is one of the biggest improvements to the language since the sound type system in Dart 2.0. It eliminates a whole class of bugs, makes code easier to maintain, and results in smaller and faster apps. If you have an existing code base and you want to reap the benefits of sound null safety, you need to migrate your code to null safety. While there are some tools that help with the migration, migrating a bigger codebase while keep shipping new features can be challenging. In this talk, Vince will go through the basics of null safety and will share some of his tips for migrating bigger projects.

> In this lightning talk, Vince will talk about how to develop a widget and share it with others on pub.dev, and how to design a package so that others can easily use and customize it.
>
> The weekday_selector package is a collection of Flutter widgets and classes to help you select weekdays in your apps. Perfect for recurring events, alarms. Vince will talk about internationalization support, theming, customization options and providing a familiar experience in your package for all Flutter and Dart developers

This talk is inspired by the [`weekday_selector`](https://pub.dev/packages/weekday_selector) open-source package that I developed.

> Did you realize that you can target practically all platforms with Dart? Flutter lets you write mobile apps for iOS, Android and desktop, and web support is already on the way. AngularDart is a mature technology for writing web apps. There are great web backend frameworks and you can also write command-line scripts with Dart.
> At this session, Vince talks about his experience with Dart on the backend.

## Interaction between Flutter and native iOS or Android at Flutter Munich

> 📍 codecentric Munich 🗓 April 4, 2019 🗣 Flutter Munich

[🔖  Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fp5MWeRnDlGL7oj-575eG3PfaDsc7CepU3xeCfBv1Nw/edit?usp=sharing) // [🎤  Event page](https://www.meetup.com/Flutter-Munich/events/258629827/)

> In most cases, Flutter lives up to its promise and lets you develop apps fast for both mobile platforms using a single codebase. But what happens when you need to use SDKs, libraries or platform-specific APIs that Flutter does not yet support? Worry not! In this talk, I'm going through the most common problems and their solutions developers face when they start using Flutter and have to rely on platform-specific APIs and native modules.

This talk is inspired by the [`esptouch_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/esptouch_flutter) open-source plugin that I developed.
